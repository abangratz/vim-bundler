INTRODUCTION                                    *bundler*

Install in ~/.vim, or in ~\vimfiles if you're on Windows.

COMMANDS                                        *bundler-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *bundler-:Bundle*
:Bundle [args]          Run an arbitrary bundler command. Similar to 
                        :!bundle [args] but chdir to the project tree first.

GLOBAL SETTINGS                                 *bundler-global-settings*

The only global setting supported now is the arguments for the !bundle
command.

                                                *g:bundler_commandline_options*
>
        let g:bundler_commandline_options=""
This option controls which commandline switches are used when calling the
bundler command. The default is '--no-color' to remove erroneous quickfix list
parsing.
|g:bundler_commandline_options|
